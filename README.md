# Introduction

This project provides a base repository that can be forked to quickly bootstrap a web-based software. It is built on top of [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/). 

Our philosophy is to use 3rd-party providers as much as possible so you can focus on building your features. For instance, we use:

* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/): 
  * Realtime database
  * Cloud storage
  * Hosting 
  * User Authentication (with password reset)
* [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) for Full-text search 
* [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) to send emails 

This project is 100% JavaScript. The main reason being the great support of this language 
for all the providers we use.
